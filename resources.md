# 🛠 Drone Developer Resources (2025)

A curated list of industry-standard open-source software, simulation environments, and libraries for UAV development.

---

## 🚀 Flight Control Firmware
The core software that runs on the drone's flight controller.

* **[ArduPilot](https://ardupilot.org/)**: The most mature and versatile platform. Supports multirotors, planes, rovers, and even submarines. Ideal for hobbyists and agricultural drones.
* **[PX4 Autopilot](https://px4.io/)**: A modular, research-oriented flight stack used by industry giants like Amazon and Zipline. Highly integrated with the ROS ecosystem.
* **[Betaflight](https://betaflight.com/)**: The go-to firmware for high-performance FPV racing and freestyle drones. Optimized for low latency.

---

## 🎮 Ground Control Stations (GCS)
Software to plan missions, calibrate hardware, and monitor telemetry.

* **[QGroundControl](http://qgroundcontrol.com/)**: Provides a modern, touch-friendly UI for both PX4 and ArduPilot. Cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS).
* **[Mission Planner](https://ardupilot.org/planner/)**: The powerhouse for ArduPilot users. Offers deep engineering tools, log analysis, and complex mission planning (Windows only).
* **[MAVProxy](https://ardupilot.org/mavproxy/)**: A command-line GCS for power users. Excellent for scripting and managing MAVLink networks.

---

## 💻 Simulation Environments (SITL)
Test your code in a virtual world before risking hardware.

* **[Gazebo (Garden/Harmonic)](https://gazebosim.org/)**: The industry standard for robotics. Offers high-fidelity physics and seamless integration with ROS 2.
* **[AirSim](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim)**: Built on Unreal Engine. Provides photorealistic environments and is the best choice for AI and Computer Vision research.
* **[Webots](https://cyberbotics.com/)**: A lightweight, efficient open-source simulator frequently used in educational and swarm robotics projects.

---

## 📚 Developer SDKs & APIs
Build your own apps to control drones programmatically.

* **[MAVSDK](https://mavsdk.mavlink.io/)**: The modern C++, Python, Swift, and Java library for interacting with MAVLink-based systems (PX4/ArduPilot).
* **[DroneKit](https://dronekit.io/)**: A classic Python library for ArduPilot that allows for quick prototyping of autonomous behaviors.
* **[ROS 2 (Robot Operating System)](https://www.ros.org/)**: The "middleware" of robotics. Essential for advanced autonomy like SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) and object detection.

---

## 🗺 Data Processing & Mapping
Turn aerial images into actionable data.

* **[OpenDroneMap (WebODM)](https://www.opendronemap.org/)**: An open-source toolkit for generating 3D models, point clouds, and orthophotos from drone imagery.
* **[QGIS](https://qgis.org/)**: A free and open-source Geographic Information System to analyze the maps generated by your drone.

---

## 📖 Essential Learning Links
* **[MAVLink Protocol](https://mavlink.io/en/)**: Understand the "language" drones use to communicate.
* **[Dronecode Foundation](https://www.dronecode.org/)**: The consortium governing the open-source drone ecosystem.
* **[ArduPilot Discourse](https://discuss.ardupilot.org/)** & **[PX4 Slack](https://slack.px4.io/)**: The best places to ask technical questions.
