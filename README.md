## 1. Introduction to UAVs
A **Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)** is more than just a flying machine; it is a component of a **UAS (Unmanned Aerial System)**.

| Term | Scope |
| :--- | :--- |
| **UAV** | The physical aircraft/drone. |
| **UAS** | The UAV + Ground Control Station (GCS) + Data Links + Software. |

---

## 2. Evolution & Classification
### Historical Timeline
* **Early 1900s–1950s:** Military remote-controlled targets.
* **1960s–1990s:** Advanced reconnaissance & early digital telemetry.
* **2000s–Present:** The "Drone Explosion"—MEMS sensors, LiPo batteries, and AI.

### Classification Metrics
Drones are categorized based on **Weight**, **Endurance**, **Autonomy Level**, and **Structural Design**.

---

## 3. Types of Drones & Applications

### 🌀 Multirotor
* **Design:** Quadcopters, Hexacopters.
* **Best For:** Precise hovering, photography, and indoor flight.
* **Limit:** Low battery endurance (15–40 mins).

### ✈️ Fixed-Wing
* **Design:** Airplane-like wings.
* **Best For:** Mapping vast areas, long-range surveillance.
* **Limit:** Requires a runway or launcher; cannot hover.

### 🔁 VTOL (Vertical Take-Off & Landing)
* **Design:** Hybrid (Multirotor + Fixed-wing).
* **Best For:** Long-range missions starting from confined spaces.

## 4. Core System Components
A drone is an integrated **cyber-physical system**:

1.  **Flight Controller (FC):** The brain (runs ArduPilot/PX4). Uses IMUs for stability.
2.  **Propulsion:** BLDC Motors + ESCs + Propellers.
3.  **Power:** LiPo/Li-ion batteries + Power Distribution Boards (PDB).
4.  **Sensors:** GPS (Navigation), Barometer (Altitude), LiDAR (Obstacle avoidance).
5.  **Payload:** Gimbals, Cameras, Sprayers, or Cargo hooks.

---

## 5. Software Ecosystem
| Type | Popular Software |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Autopilot Firmware** | PX4, ArduPilot, Betaflight |
| **Ground Control (GCS)** | QGroundControl, Mission Planner |
| **Mapping/Photogrammetry**| Pix4D, OpenDroneMap |
| **Simulation** | AirSim, Gazebo |

---

## 6. Industry & Market Trends
* **Market Size:** Projected to reach **$160B+ by 2030**.
* **Key Players:** DJI, Skydio, Autel, ideaForge (India).
* **Trends:** Swarm intelligence, Edge AI, and Urban Air Mobility (UAM).

---

## 7. Regulatory Framework (2025)

### 🇮🇳 India (DGCA)
* **DigitalSky Platform:** Mandatory registration for most categories.
* **Categories:** Nano (<250g), Micro (250g-2kg), Small (2kg-25kg).
* **Zones:** Red (No-fly), Yellow (Restricted), Green (Permitted).

### 🇺🇸 USA (FAA)
* **Remote ID:** Mandatory for nearly all drones.
* **Part 107:** Required for commercial operations.

## 🛠 8. Hands-on Activity
### Research Task: Real-World Solution
Analyze how a drone solves a specific industry problem.
1.  **Pick a Domain:** (Agriculture / Delivery / Inspection).
2.  **Identify Tech:** What sensors/software are used?
3.  **Analyze:** What was the ROI (Return on Investment)?
